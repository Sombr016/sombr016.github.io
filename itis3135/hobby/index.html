            <h2>Home</h2>
            <p>Fighting Games are a genre of video games that have existed for decades now. Everyone has heard of fighting games at some point in their life whether it is popular legacy series like Street Fighter and Tekken to more recent games such as Guilty Gear Strive and 2XKO. Fighting games are often one player verses another competing to knock out the other player.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption> Gameplay of Street Fighter 6</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Street Fighter is one of the original fighting games and sticks very close to the genres roots. We have seen other games innovate on this formula such as the Marvel vs Capcom series allowing players to play with teams of three characters in each match or the Tekken series moving games from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions</p>
            <p>On the other pages of this site I will explain the other various aspects of fighting games such as the community, how people play them, and where people go to do so.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section id="about">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As for me I current help to run a local tournament in Charlotte, NC called "Charlotte Showdown". Tournaments are held at the end of each month on weekends at UNC Charlotte. While it is hosted on a college campus the events can be entered by anyone. I handel all the live streaming for all our events and assist in running events when needed. </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>The logo for Charlotte Showdown and a picture of our staff and attendees.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>The games we run at our events are often associated with the "anime" sub-genre of fighting games but we do offer more traditional games such as Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="schedule">
            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <p>Charlotte Showdown the event I help to run is a monthly which means it runs once each month. Other fighting games events typically run seasonally so around 4 times per year or once a year. EVO which is the largest fighting game event has their main event once a year typically in august with other smaller events running at various times through out the year.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>While large events are the flashy way to play these games it is not the only way. Thousands of people around the world log on to their favorite game each day and play online. Some games have robust online features letting you play whenever while others require you to ask for matches on community platforms such as discord.</p>
            <p>There are also various online events hosted for most major games through sites like start.gg. With the advent of the internet people have been able to play fighting games whenever they want instead of hoping to have a place where people consistently meet in-person to play them.</p>

        <section id="location">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>There are two main types of locations that fighting games are played in</p>
            <p>1. In person, this is the traditional way to play these games. Starting all the way back in the arcades this involves people meeting at a location and playing on the same device. These places can range from the few arcades that are still around, bars, college campuses, or other public spaces.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>2. Online. Many games feature matchmaking or player made rooms for other players to play with each other online. There is also matchmaking through communities such as discord where players with find others to play with. This option has become very popular in recent years as it is easier to find people and places to play in-person have diminished</p>
