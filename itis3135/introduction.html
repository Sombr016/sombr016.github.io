            Hello everyone I am Jacob Kilcrease. I am taking this class from a friend's recommendation and since I have very little experience with HTML and CSS. I play a lot of video games and various mountain based activities, mainly mountain biking and skiing. I have also been trying to re-learn to play the piano and drumset which I used to play back in high school but stopped doing since coming to college.

            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I have lived in Raleigh, NC my whole life and never moved houses. My family used to own a house in Beech mountain where we would frequently go so Boone is like a second home for me despite never living there full time.</li>

                    <li><strong>ITSC3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society:</strong> I have always had an interest in sociology and ethics and with me mainly focusing on AI with my degree I felt it important to understand how modern technology has impacted people.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS3156 - Intro to Machine Learning:</strong> There are small bits of personal research I have done with machine learning but it is important to take a full class on the subject especially if I am to make a career around it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Math2164- Matrices and Linear Algebra:</strong> Very important mathematical base for many concepts in computer science.</li>
