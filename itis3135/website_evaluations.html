            <h3><a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">Space Jam</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website was for promoting the 1996 film "Space Jam". This website contains many pieces of
                promotional material for the movie. The home for the page is in the design of a solar system with
                different planets taking you to various pages with information about the movie. From these pages you can
                view the trailer for the movie, the sound track, cast list, and go to the Warner Brothers website.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast
                    <p>
                        Very Poor. The background for each page is a back background with a lot of stars. This causes
                        many elements on the page to be very hard to view.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Repitition
                    <p>
                        Very poor. Some pages have the paragraph text in red and some are in yellow. The main page does
                        not have a header but the subpages do so there is this snaping feeling that occurs. The Junior
                        Jam background is lime green which is a hard change on the users eyes
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Alignment
                    <p>
                        Good. Paragraph text is center aligned and headers are in the center. All of the images at the
                        top of the page are centered so they are easy to view.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Proximity
                    <p>
                        Ok. There are not many elements on each page so any proximity issues are not very noticable.
                        Everything uses a default spacing so if anything is supposed to be grouped together it is hard
                        to tell.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie">Wikipedia</a></h3>
            <p>
                Wikipedia is a website to me that illustrates some great design princibles while also being very simple.
                For this example I am using the wikipedia page for Cookies (the dessert) but this applys to most
                wikipedia pages. This webpage specificly talks about what cookies are and how they where created.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast
                    <p>
                        Good. Using the default colors for backgrounds, text, and links is not bad but makes the website
                        a bit lazy. This does give clear distinctions between normal text and links while also being
                        easy to read. all images and extra information has a different background color making it clear
                        where it belongs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Repitition
                    <p>
                        Perfect. Everything from headers and links to the paragraph text is all consistant. Each image
                        has a caption with it in the same format and each header has a horizontal row.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Alignment
                    <p>
                        Great. All pieces of text are kept inline with eachother. My only problem is that the h1 is not
                        centered
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Proximity
                    <p>
                        Perfect. This is what wikipedia is the best at. There are three clear sections on the webpage
                        from a table of contents on the left, main content in the middle, and settings on the right.
                    </p>
