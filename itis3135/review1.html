                    <li>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand: The homepage
                        include
                        the site name was a little welcome message which is appropriate.</li>

                        location): ✓</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Client Project Rubric
                <ul>
                    <li>Consistent Layout: ✓</li>
                    <li>Appropriate content on the home page: ✓</li>

                    <li>Navigational Bar is consistent position across pages: ✓</li>
                    <li>3 Product/Service Pages with appropriate content: ✓ </li>
                    <li>Documentation: X</li>
                    <li>Aesthetics: While I think it looks nice the main of each page is black text on a white
                        background. The rounded edges keep it from looking like complete default settings. Log in and
                        Post use default user input boxes which does not look good and also have spacing issues on the
                        page</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
